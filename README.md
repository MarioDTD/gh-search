### Instructions

1. Start the app by runnning npm start in the terminal and open http://localhost:3000

2. As you enter the page the search bar will be focused on so you can quickly type in what you need to search for

3. When typing in the search bar it will take about 1 second to load the search results in order to prevent consuming the quota quickly

4. Results will be displayed at the bottom of the search bar within their individual cards with links to the individual repository.

### Notes

- As I am still very new to React and in the process of getting familiar with it. I still can't figure out how to send my search query to the URL params
  without submitting the form with the enter key or a search button.
